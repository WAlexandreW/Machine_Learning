# Machine-learning repo

Some snippets I often use in most of my projects.

There are (and will be) many snippets, for example:
- Useful & quick pre-analysis codes (descriptive statistics, anomalies detections, etc...) 
- Most used Pre-Processing codes & functions
- Reinforcement learning snippets (based on Open AI's gym, Stable Baseline, Ray/Tune/Rllib)

And others codes i find very useful or that I'll like to improve.
